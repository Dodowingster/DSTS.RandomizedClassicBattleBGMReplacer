This is a **Work In Progress** music mod that aims to enhance the combat experience by replacing and randomly cycling through a selection of iconic battle themes from the **Digimon Videogame franchise**.

**Key Features:**

  * **Nostalgic Digimon Sound:** Replaces several in-game tracks with music sourced from *Digimon Adventure PSP*, *Digimon World*, *Digimon Digital Card Battle*, *Digimon Rumble Arena*, and more.
  * **Randomized Tracks:** Most of the in-game battle themes now have **two alternative tracks** that will play randomly, increasing variety and replayability.
  * **Add-On Version:** Don't feel like replacing the tracks? Get this version instead that keeps the Original DSTS Tracks while adding the Classic Theme.

It replaces and randomizes the following tracks:

-----

## **RANDOMIZED Normal Battle(s)**

**Engage the Anomaly 1**

**Engage the Anomaly 2**

**Engage the Anomaly 3**

[Digimon Rumble Arena The Biggest Dreamer](https://youtu.be/tBS70leI4YY) & [Digimon Rumble Arena Out in the Country](https://youtu.be/8KDzQmA4WeQ)

!! IMPORTANT !!
Engage the Anomaly in the Music Settings is a different track than the actual default battle themes as it is a compilation of all 3 Time Stranger Default Battle Theme in one. My Mod only replaces the Random 3 not the compilation track itself.

**Looming Threat**

[Digimon World Major Battle](https://youtu.be/zn2LH1sGAks) & [Digimon World Next Order Major Battle](https://youtu.be/PHiz-dJKq4Q)

## **\!\! IMPORTANT \!\!**

**Engage the Anomaly** in the **Music Settings is a different track** than the actual default battle themes as it is a **compilation of all 3 Time Stranger Default Battle Theme** in one. My Mod only **replaces the Random 3** not the compilation track itself.

## **FAQ:**

**Q**: How do I know if this mod worked or I installed this mod correctly?
**A**: Open your music settings and check the replaced/addon songs like **UPPER MIND** or **Looming Threat**. Testing on **Engage the Anomaly** in the in the Music Settings will still play the default battle theme because of the reasons I already stated above.

**Q**: Can you randomize the paid **DLC songs**?
**A**: Can but I wouldn't post it **publicly** as that would be against copyright law against **BANDAI NAMCO**

**Q**: I don't like x track, can I safely **delete them** from your mod, it wouldn't break anything right?
**A**: It would break my heart. Lol. But **YES YOU CAN**. Delete whatever track you don't want to hear is completely fine\!
